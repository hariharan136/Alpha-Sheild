# 🛡️ AlphaShield

**AlphaShield** is an interactive and comprehensive security hardening and auditing tool for Linux servers. It assists system administrators in securing their servers by automating common security practices and audits.

---

## ✨ Features

- 📊 **System Information Gathering**  
  Collects detailed system info, network configuration, uptime, user accounts, etc.

- 🔍 **Security Audit**  
  Runs multiple checks on SSH, firewall, ports, updates, fail2ban, and more. Generates a full report (`vps-audit-report-*.txt`).

- ⚙️ **Server Configuration**  
  Automatically hardens server security based on your Linux distribution (Ubuntu / CentOS / Rocky / AlmaLinux).

- 🕵️ **Honeypot Deployment**  
  Simulates a fake environment to catch and log intrusion attempts.

---

## 📁 File Structure

- `Alpha Shield.sh` - Main script that handles menu and subfunctions.
- Audit reports are saved as: `LinuxAudit.txt` or `vps-audit-report-*.txt`
- Honeypot logs saved as: `log_honeypot.txt` (if selected)
